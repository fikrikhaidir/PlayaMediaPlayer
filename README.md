## What is Playa Media Player ?
Playa Media Player is a Media Player with shake detection function provided to change played song.
This is one of my projects from mobile programming subject. 
There is some known bug such as activity switching keep creating new activities. but you could just resolve it with flags. and i've been deleting some assets because i forgot where i got that. but you could always replace them.

This repo might or might not be updated.
note : this player assumes that you have "Music/" dir right in your SDCard dir. i hardcode it that way.
